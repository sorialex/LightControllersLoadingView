# LightControllersLoadingView

With the aim of write something using **Swift protocol extension** and based on <http://khanlou.com/2016/02/many-controllers> I wrote a **basic activity indicator** that could be used in any project.
Just including the required files it makes pretty easy to show an activity indicator with a **clean code**. Its not a final code, just a **practice** =D.
